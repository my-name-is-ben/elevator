# Elevator Project

An elevator sim for a job interview.


## Instructions Provided

Before interviewing we have all candidates complete an Elevator Project. Please see details and review the instructions below and complete the project accordingly.

* Provide code that simulates an elevator. You are free to use any language.

* Upload the completed project to GitHub (public) for discussion during interview.

* Document all assumptions and any features that werenâ€™t implemented.

* The result should be an executable, or script, that can be run with the following inputs and generate the following outputs.

  ```
  Inputs: [list of floors to visit] (e.g. elevator start=12 floor=2,9,1,32)

  Outputs: [total travel time, floors visited in order] (e.g. 560 12,2,9,1,32)

  Program Constants: Single floor travel time: 10
  ```

Submission Instructions:

Once your project is complete, please upload it to GitHub and send me the link at least 48 business hours prior to your scheduled interview. This will allow the team enough time to review your project prior to the interview.


## Assumptions
Based on the provided instructions, it looks like a very simple project / script.

The inputs and outputs are a little vague (Should the input be one single list or an int and a list? Should the output be a single list or two separate items?) but I assume that this is to give the candidate a bit of flexibility in how they approach the assignment.

I also assume that since those are the only inputs and outputs requested, that is the only functionality that is being asked to be simulated.

I went back-and-forth a bit trying to decide how much time and effort to put into this. On one hand, I feel like the assignment can be solved pretty easily with a couple lines in a bash script, but since the interview is scheduled for an hour, I don't know how much there would be to actually talk about or how much that would showcase my talents or problem-solving abilities.

On the other hand, maybe the assignment is meant to be easy, and the interview is meant to see if I'm just doing the bare minimum or whether I actually put a little time and effort to making something worth talking about for more than 30 seconds? Should I build an entire web application from scratch, model the elevator and a 100 story building in Fusion, import some physics libraries, deploy the whole thing using CI/CD pipelines, and allow floor inputs via a realistic looking elevator panel?

So I went with a bit of a middle ground approach and created a couple different smaller options that I hope satisfy the intent of the assignement while still allowing me to sleep and spend some time with my family over the weekend.

## The actual code

__elevator_v1__ <br>
This is just a basic python script that can be run from the terminal. It uses the native `argparse` module
to accept and parse inputs. No input validation outside of that which is included with `argparse`. Output is just printed to the screen.

To run the script:

`python elevator.py -s <starting_floor> -f <list of floors to visit>`

Example:

`python elevator.py -s 12 -f 32 14 7 99`

<br>


__elevator_v2__ <br>
An Elevator class, with some brief input validation during class instantiation, defined within it's own module so that it can be imported. All inputs and calculations are done during instantiation and getter methods are used to retrieve the values.

I created a test script `run_tests.py` that is designed to run against the elevator module and test for valid inputs and ensure calculations are correct.

To run the test script:

`python run_tests.py -v`

<br>


__elevator_v3__ <br>
I started working on this at like 10pm Monday night. The plan was to do a bit of brainstorming, go into a bit more depth, maybe flesh out the idea and put some more thought and effort into it, but it started to look less like an elevator sim and more like elevator software so I abandoned that approach.
